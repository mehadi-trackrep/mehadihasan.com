# Elasticsearch End-to-End Request Process Abstract Flow üß†

Definitely It will be very helpful to deep dive in a service if you really know how it manages the thing under the hood.


### ‚ùì What occurs when a client makes a search or index request to Elasticsearch?

When a client initiates a search or indexing request to Elasticsearch, the system follows a defined sequence of processing steps.

üí° A high-level request processing workflow is illustrated the picture.

‚ÑπÔ∏è ES domain introduced by VPC, the AWS PrivateLink maintain the cluster internal load balancing. Explicitly it doesn't use Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB).

The request is received by a node within the cluster, which then assumes the role of the coordinating node. This node then gets the responsibility of managing the entire lifecycle of the request.

N.B. Coordinating node, also known as client node.  It's the "project manager" for the request.

Happy learning! üìö
