# How Elasticsearch Clusters Manage Node Memory and Storage Layout ðŸ§ 

ðŸ’¡ AWS OpenSearch (formerly Elasticsearch) manages each nodeâ€™s memory and storage much like a traditional server, but applies its own internal management mechanisms and operational workflows.

The diagram below provides a simplified, easy-to-understand layout.

In short, it illustrates the following:
#### `[ Physical RAM ]`
       â”‚
       â”œâ”€â”€ [ JVM Process (Elasticsearch) ]
       â”‚         â”‚
       â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ [ JVM Heap Memory ]
       â”‚         â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ Java objects
       â”‚         â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ Threadpools
       â”‚         â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ Indexing buffers
       â”‚         â”‚         â””â”€â”€ (Optional) Heap Data Structure object
       â”‚         â”‚
       â”‚         â””â”€â”€ [ Other JVM Memory: Stack, Metaspace, Native Memory ]
       â”‚
       â””â”€â”€ [ OS Page Cache, Other Processes, etc. ]


Let's see simply again the working paths (Indexing Path & Search Path).

### Indexing Path
```
    Client
    â†“
    Threadpool (write/bulk)  [JVM Heap]
    â†“
    Indexing buffer          [JVM Heap]
    â†“
    Lucene in-memory segment
    â†“ (flush)
    OS Page Cache            [RAM outside JVM heap]
    â†“
    EBS Volume               [Persistent disk storage]

```

### Search Path
```
    Client
    â†“
    Threadpool (search)      [JVM Heap]
    â†“
    Lucene segment read
    â†“ (hits OS page cache if warm, else EBS read)
    OS Page Cache            [RAM outside JVM heap]
    â†“
    Optional: Query Cache    [JVM Heap]
    â†“
    Response sent to client
```

#### ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways
* **Threadpools & queues** â†’ JVM heap.
* **In-memory indexing buffers & caches** â†’ JVM heap.
* **Segment file content for searches** â†’ OS page cache (outside JVM heap, still RAM).
* **EBS volume** is persistent storage; OS page cache + Lucene memory-mapped files keep hot data in RAM.
* **Half RAM for heap**, **half for OS cache** is the golden rule.

Happy learning! ðŸ“š
