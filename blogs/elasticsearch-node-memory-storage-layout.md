# How Elasticsearch Cluster Manages Node Memory and Storage Layout? ðŸ§ 

ðŸ’¡ AWS OpenSearch (/Elasticsearch) manages each node's memory and storage similar to a computer.
But it interpretes the things in its own management system and working paths.

A simple & easily understandable layout diagram shown in the picture.
Concisely it depicts like:
#### `[ Physical RAM ]`
       â”‚
       â”œâ”€â”€ [ JVM Process (Elasticsearch) ]
       â”‚         â”‚
       â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ [ JVM Heap Memory ]
       â”‚         â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ Java objects
       â”‚         â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ Threadpools
       â”‚         â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ Indexing buffers
       â”‚         â”‚         â””â”€â”€ (Optional) Heap Data Structure object
       â”‚         â”‚
       â”‚         â””â”€â”€ [ Other JVM Memory: Stack, Metaspace, Native Memory ]
       â”‚
       â””â”€â”€ [ OS Page Cache, Other Processes, etc. ]


Let's see simply again the working paths (Indexing Path & Search Path).

### Indexing Path
```
    Client
    â†“
    Threadpool (write/bulk)  [JVM Heap]
    â†“
    Indexing buffer          [JVM Heap]
    â†“
    Lucene in-memory segment
    â†“ (flush)
    OS Page Cache            [RAM outside JVM heap]
    â†“
    EBS Volume               [Persistent disk storage]

```

### Search Path
```
    Client
    â†“
    Threadpool (search)      [JVM Heap]
    â†“
    Lucene segment read
    â†“ (hits OS page cache if warm, else EBS read)
    OS Page Cache            [RAM outside JVM heap]
    â†“
    Optional: Query Cache    [JVM Heap]
    â†“
    Response sent to client
```
