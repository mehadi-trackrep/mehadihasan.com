# 🚀 Let’s talk about a very simple SQL concept but heavily used — 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡.
Usually, we use it with one joining / matching condition, but sometimes there can be multiple conditions depending on the scenario.

🤔 When do we need a Self JOIN?
We use it when we want to 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲.

For example:  
- Finding employees who share the same manager.  
- Comparing product prices to find cheaper or more expensive alternatives.  
- Detecting duplicate values in a dataset.  

> 

This is particularly useful for:
1. **Hierarchical Data**: For example, employees and their managers, or categories and subcategories. It's kind of parent-child relationship exploration.
2. **Comparing Rows within the Same Table**: For example, finding customers who live in the same city, or identifying duplicate records based on certain criteria.
3. **Analyzing Sequential Data**: Where the current record's value depends on a previous record's value, such as calculating the difference between a current day's sales and the previous day's sales within a single sales table.

Let's see a SQL problem from **Leetcode** — Rising Temperature.

### Problem Statement

```
Table: Weather

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
There are no different rows with the same recordDate.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to
its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.
```

💡 The solution will be like this —

```
SELECT w2.id
FROM Weather w1 JOIN weather w2
    ON (w1.recordDate = w2.recordDate - INTERVAL '1 day')
WHERE w2.temperature > w1.temperature;
```
